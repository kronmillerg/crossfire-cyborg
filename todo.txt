Setup package structure:
    main/   --  main script directory
    lib/    --  scripts that are imported
    test/   --  one-off test scripts, not useful in their own right
    notes/  --  text files in which I write notes/plans/whatever

Add a script to sort stuff in my apartment based on client_type.
